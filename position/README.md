### What:
    - It's a property - used to specify how an element is positioned in a document.
    - It determines the "layout" and "placement" of elements on a web page.

### Why:
    - Fine-grained control over element placement.
    - More dynamic and complex layouts that aren't possible with standard document flow.

### When:
    - Create overlapping elements.
    - Build sticky headers or sidebars.
    - Create pop-ups or modals.

### How:
    - position: absolute;
    - 5 values
        1. static (default)
        2. relative
        3. absolute
        4. fixed
        5. sticky

### Doubts:
    1. "layout" vs "placement"
